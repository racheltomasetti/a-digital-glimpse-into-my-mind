# A Glimpse Into My Mind

ðŸ”—[https://www.racheltomasetti.com](https://www.racheltomasetti.com)

**My personal website â€” a living, evolving touchpoint for anyone curious about what Iâ€™m building, learning, thinking about, or dreaming up.**

But more than that, itâ€™s a window into my mind.


## The Journey


Creating this site has been a long, nonlinear journey â€” one thatâ€™s stretched over a year of learning, building, breaking, and rebuilding. At first, the biggest challenge was technical: I had a vision for what I wanted to create, but not yet the skills to bring it to life. Slowly, through late nights, trial and error, and the growing magic of AI tools, that gap began to close. I reached a point where I could build anything I imagined.

And then a different kind of challenge emerged:  
**What do I even put here?**


## The Why

I had so much I wanted to share â€” ideas, questions, projects, philosophies, curiosities â€” but no clear way to structure them. This site became my answer. A place not just to show *what* I do, but *how* I think. A home for the messy, beautiful process of becoming. A place where my thoughts can live, connect, evolve â€” and maybe resonate with someone else.


## For my Self

Thereâ€™s a selfish element, too.  
This project is also for me: to track my evolution, make sense of my scattered thoughts, and feel a little less alone in this surreal, expansive journey of discovery. Because while the process of creating, learning, and building has felt magical, itâ€™s also felt isolating at times â€” like Iâ€™m in a wormhole no one else can see into. This site is my way of shining a little light outward.

Thanks for visiting â€” and checking out even a small glimpse of whatâ€™s going on inside.


With love,
